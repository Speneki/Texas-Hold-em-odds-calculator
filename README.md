Here we can see the way my javascript proposal should look as a completed project. Each square will be a clickable box that gives an option to place any remaining card from the deck. It will claculate the odds of one hand against one opponent preflop, on the flop, on the turn and the river. 

## Functionality: 
  - Users can place any hand against any other possible hand thier opponent could make
  - Users can quickly calculate their available remaining outs to see their change of winning
  
## MVPS
  - [ ] logic behind any hand vs any other calculation 
  - [ ] interface in which a user can decide thier hand and their opponents
  - [ ] cards, when selected, are removed from the possible selection of cards
  - [ ] percentage updates as soon as a calculation is available
  
## Development Timeline

  ### Day One: 
  - [ ] find proper APIs for generating Hands, displaying cards
  - [ ] find proper API for calculating winner
